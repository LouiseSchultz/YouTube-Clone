# YouTube-Clone

## About Project

The YouTube-Clone is a web application that aims to replicate the main functionalities and design of the most popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. This is one of the first projects I worked on, teaching me HTML and CSS. It provides users with a similar user interface but not the well-known YouTube functionalities, neither its contents.
